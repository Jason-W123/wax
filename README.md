# Wax
A simple, zero-dependency smart contract framework for Arbitrum Stylus, written in Zig

## Philosophy

- Simple router-based app framework
- Supports middleware
- Tiny binaries
- Maximum performance
- Learn it in an afternoon (even with zero Zig experience)
- Avoid esoteric language features wherever possible
- Stick with basic building blocks as much as possible: functions, structs, arrays, enums
- Easily testable
